`# Simple Keylogger

## Overview

The **Simple Keylogger** is a Python-based tool that records and logs keystrokes on a computer. This tool is intended for educational purposes only, emphasizing ethical considerations and the importance of obtaining permission before usage.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures every key pressed on the keyboard.
- **File Storage**: Saves logged keystrokes to a specified text file for later review.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## Installation

To set up the Simple Keylogger, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagdishtripathy/Simple-Keylogger.git `

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd Simple-Keylogger`

2.  **Install Dependencies**: If your project requires any libraries, you can specify them in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Usage
-----

1.  **Running the Keylogger**:

    -   Execute the script to start logging keystrokes:

        bash

        Copy code

        `python keylogger.py`

    -   The keylogger will begin recording keystrokes and saving them to the designated file.
2.  **Stopping the Keylogger**:

    -   You can stop the keylogger using a specific keyboard shortcut or by closing the terminal window, depending on your implementation.

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

**Important**: This keylogger should only be used in controlled environments where you have explicit permission from users. Unauthorized use of a keylogger is illegal and unethical.
